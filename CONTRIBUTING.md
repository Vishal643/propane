If you want to contribute to the repo, it would be helpful if you first posted in issues so we know what you'll be working on. Also be sure to check closed issues and
current pull requests, to make sure you work on something new. After that, run these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Vishal643/propane.git
npm install
git fetch
git checkout name-of-branch (check from branch list or make new)
```
And code away! For pushing the code to your branch after you're done, use `git push origin name-of-branch`
